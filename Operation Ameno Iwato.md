My responsibility is to support district to achieve those goal.  
But what can I do for it?  
  
The keyword is "Attract."  
Attract members to retain membership.  
Attract guests to become a member.  
Then it leads to **No1 GrowthMaster in the world**
  
But how can we attract people?  
"Attract" it is easy to say but difficult to do.  
Do you have any ideas?  
  
I found an example in Japanese myth. Ameno Iwato.  
The story is:  
(天の岩戸の概要)  
  
Why Ameterasu opened the door?
Because it sounds fun and interesting.
  
The keywords are fun and interesting.  
  
Why did you open the door of the club?  
Why are you being a member of the club?  
There are many reasons.
But if there is no fun and no interesting activities, it is difficult to keep doing toastmasters activity.  
  
Let's make every meeting fun and interesting.  
And attract passer-by and make them "What is happening inside the room?"  
And turn them into guests.  
And attract guests with interesting speeches.  
And turn them into members!!  
  
There are many ways to attract people.  
As a division director, I will visit many clubs as possible and learn there unique way to attract people.  
Then exchange ideas among clubs to grow our clubs.
