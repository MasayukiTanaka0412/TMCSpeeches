Now, we have almost all required parts for android to mimic human  
## Then what makes human aprt from androids?
In the stroy of "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" The hero's job is to find illegal androids and process it.  
"Process" here means "Kill"  
I really want to know "The difference between human and android", not so that be processed by him.
In the story, it was said "The difference is whether thay have 'empathy or not'"  
  
I might be an android.

The story was written in half century ago, what was "Fiction" is becoming real.  
But its suggestion, "Empathy" makes us apart from androids is still Valid.  
Technology is changing so fast, day by day.
But what is the most important thing as human doesn't change
"Empathy"
