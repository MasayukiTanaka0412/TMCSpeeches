Are you pessimist or optimist?  
I am pessimist.  
But at the same time, I amd optimist.  
You may feel I am getting crazy. People who know me recognize me as a logical speaker.  
You may feel logical TM Tanaka has gone.  
Being pessimist and optimist at the same time is not logical at all. He should go to hospital to check his mental disorder.  
I hope I am still fine and logical.

In my 20's, I was too much optimistic.  
I was a computer programmer, and my area of expertise was really new in Japan.  
No colleague has a knowledge in that area, so I became a specialist from very first year of my career.  
It made me arrogant and hubristic.  
By the way, do you know "[three great virtues of a programmer](http://threevirtues.com/)?"  
They are:
  
- Laiziness
- Impatiance
- Hubris
  
I was (or am) lazy. I was (or am) impatient, I was (or am) hubristic.  
Oh, I am natural born great programmer.  
That feeling made myself optimistic.  
Also, I was optimistic for others.  
I am at the first year of my career, why not others can do the same thing?  
  
As I was a pioneer in that area, I became a leader in that project.  
But I was too optimistic, the project schedule I made was never met, because my estimation was too optimistic.  
  
Finally, I got frustrated and depressed.

In my 30's, I was too much pessimistic.  
The experience in my 20's made me pessimistic.  
But pessimism didn't work also.  
Because I was a pessimist, my project plan was too much conservative, I added buffer to my plan.  
When I felt I need 5 members, I said  to my boss 'I need 10 members'  
When I felt I need 6 months to complete the project, I said to my boss 'I need 12 months'  
Then my boss said 'Do it in 3 months with 3 members'
  
Again, I got frustrated and depressed.

Now, in my 40's I am optimist and pessimist.  
During struggling in my 30's, I met a management principle "[Disagree and commit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit)"  
According to the Wikipedia, it is  
> Disagree and commit is a management principle which states that individuals are allowed to disagree while a decision is being made, but that once a decision has been made, everybody must commit to it.  
  
It changed my mind. Once I did my best in my area of responsibilities and my expertise, what ever decision made by my boss or others I commit myself to the decision made.  
Whoever made the decision should be accountable for the result made, it's not mine.  
(Of course, if the decision is made by me, it's mine)  
  
What I can do is what I can do.  
I devote myself into what I can do.  
What I cannot do is what I cannot do.  
I stopped concerning what Ia cannot do, it's none of my business.  

I am optimistic for whatever under my control, but pessimistic for whatever out of my control.
This policy keep my mind healthy.

Recently, I stopped to watch Japanese news program.  
Because it is full of "My best plan to fight against COVID-19" by non-experts, and full of blaming to other who don't follow "My best plan"  
I'm fed up with such a non-sense discussion.  
Instead, I'm focusing on the things I can do.  
  
- I'm very good at keeping social distance, even before the pandemic
- I'm very good at Working From Home, even before the pandemic
- I know how to conduct online meeting
- I have a chance to present my idea at toastmasters club meetings
  
That's why I wand to do my speech today.  
Sometimes, you may feel stress under current situation.  
Let's forget or temporary forget the things not under your control.  
Find something you can do and focus on it.
