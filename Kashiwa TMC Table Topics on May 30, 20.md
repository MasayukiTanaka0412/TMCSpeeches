In this article, there was an experiment how to increase sales in a retail store.  
Both AI and human developed a plan to increase the sales and executed.  
The result was:
  
- AI developed plan increased the sales by 15%

These include cybersecurity, training, military recruitment, veterans’ healthcare, and search and rescue. These collaborations are important and we’ll actively look for more ways to augment the critical work of these organizations and keep service members and civilians safe.
