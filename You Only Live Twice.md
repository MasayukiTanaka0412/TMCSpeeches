Two decades ago, I felt I became a successful person.  
I quit college.  
Why does it lead to be a successful person?
Because every person whom I respect quit college.  
Now, I'm one of them.  
I got a ticket to success.  
  
Soon after, I started a first step to success.  
I started my career as a computer programmer.  
At that time, IT industry was in paradigm shift  
The companies were shifting from a large computer in a dedicated room to personal computers.  
Large computer and personal computer use different programming language.  
They are so different, it's like ancient Egyptian and Japanese.  
And I was the only one who spoke Japanese in the company.  
It didn't take much time until I became a hero.
  
Many colleagues asked me.  
"Please help me!"  
I replied 
"OK, it's a pice of cake"  
"Please help me!"  
I replied 
"OK, it's a pice of cake"
"Please help me!"  
I replied 
"OK, it's a pice of cake"
  
After a few years, I quit the company.  
Because I felt every job assigned to me was a pice of cake for me.  
I need a challenge.  
  
So, I moved to the company where I can improve my English skill.  
It was amazing and exiting for the first few month.  
But soon..  
"Please help me!"  
I replied 
"OK, it's a pice of cake"  
"Please help me!"  
I replied 
"OK, it's a pice of cake"
"Please help me!"  
I replied 
"OK, it's a pice of cake"
  
What was different is  
I suddenly died. Mentally died.  
I was so exhausted, I could not find hope for my future.  
Silently, a piece of cake became pieces of cake.  
Pieces of cake became a whole cake.
A whole cake became a huge wedding cake which I cannot eat by myself alone.  
  
During the depression, I thought the failure was due to my lack of skills.  
So, I decided to visit toastmasters club to improve my self further.  
I thought, to be successful, I need to perform far better than others.
I need to eat cake much faster and more pieces.  
And lead others by example. That is a leadership.  

But, what I saw at the toastmaster meeting was totally different.  
The meeting was well organized. But it was not lead by a few experienced members.  
All members contributed to the meeting to be successful.  
The level of skill were different but each has their own responsibility and contributed.  
VPE and toastmasters of the day carefully considered each members' skill and demand, then assigned roles.   
  
I suddenly re-born when I noticed the fact.  
This is the skill I need to develop to be successful.  
Life is not so sweet as cake.  
I'm sure I will face many challenges.  
Those might look like huge tower of cake.  
I cannot eat those by myself alone.
But now, I know how to handle those.  
Cut into pieces, share with team mates.  
The a tower of cake will turn into a sweet piece of cake.  
Sometimes, it might be still bitter, then let's think it is a chocolate cake.
