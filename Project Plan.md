## Background
  
After two years long negotiation, finally I got an approval for a new project.

But currently the software doesn't support Japanese.
  
And this proposal is how we conduct Japanization of the software

## Challenges
  
- People
    - Are we able to get members having enough skills to complete the project?
- **Communication**
    - **We need to be work at the same place at least for first several weeks**
    - **If COVID-19 is not settled when the project starts, onboarding process to the project is extremely difficult**
    - **As there is 9 hours timezone difference, timely communication might be difficult**
- Technical
    - We are not sure about technical detail of Empower
- IP
    - If they don't disclose their source code, it's difficult to get Japanese customers

## The Best Case Scenarios
  
Our developers stayed in London for 3 months, and work with their developer team closely at the same room.
  
---
  
## Options for the Worst Case Scenarios
  
If we are not abele to go to London or not able to invite them to Tokyo.
  
1. ~~We hire resources in London~~
1. Have intensive training sessions before starting the project
1. Our team will work on London time and connected closely using chat tools (slack, MS Teams)
    - Having a daily call to share the situation
