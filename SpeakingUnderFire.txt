Have you ever heard the concept Basic Income?
Basic Income is XXXXXXXX.

Today, I would like to propose Basic Income to revitalize Japanese Economy.

Why Basic Income helps to revitalize the economy?
A recent study shows more than 80% of Japanese Employees don't have a motivation for their work.
If so, why they work?
They work just for money.
We can't live without money!

There are full of motivation-less employees in the office.
Motivation-less workers cannot make innovation which is required to revitalize the economy.

How Basic Income helps to resolve the situation?
If they don't have fear for money supply, they are easily quit their job and can step into new challenges which motivate themselves.
In addition, companies are also required to change to keep the talented employees.
As a result, there would be more innovation which helps to revitalize the economy.
