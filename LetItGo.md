# Title: Let It Go
  
My mother was so strict to my education.  
  
She sent me to every kind of school, caligraphy, English, Soroban, Swimming, etc.,
  
Everyday, she asked me "Did you finish your homework?"
  
And check my exam score every time, and if the score was below 80, she asked "Why?"
  
"Why?" I don't know. If I knew "why" I could mark full score.
  
My father "had" short temper, or I should say he "has"
  
If I couldn't meet his expectation, he got mad.
  
As a result, I learned to prentend to be a good boy.
  
> Don't let them in, don't let them see.  
> Be the good girl you always have to be.  
> Conceal, don't feel don't let them know  
  
And the same time, I got frustrated when I saw the person who is not a good boy/girl.
  
After starting my career as a computer programer and when the project didn't go well, I always thought the reasons why the project didn't go well was because the members were not good.
  
So, I changed the company several times, but nothing changed.
  
In such a time, I met my current boss and he said.
  
"I appreciate your hard work, but sadly we can't force them to change. Let's focus on positive, it's a good time for you to start learning management and leadership"
  
The word releved my mind.
  
As a leader, I pretend to be a perfect but
  
> Well now they know  
> Let it go, let it go  
> Can't hold it back anymore  
> Let it go, let it go  
> Turn away and slam the door  
> I don't care  
> what they're going to say  
> Let the storm rage on.  
> The cold never bothered me anyway  
  
Yes, I'm not perfect. But so what? 
  
Whatever negative thing happens, let it go.
  
Anyway we can't hold it back anymore.
  
Let the storm rage on.
  
The past never bothered me anyway
  
Instead, focus on future, focus on positives and make our life more fruitful.
  
(Some example here)
  
focus on future, focus on positives
  
Thanks
