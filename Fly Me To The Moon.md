Fly Me To The Moon

## Script

I have been a member fot this club since its establishment.  
So many members know me for more than two years.  
Some members know me at others clubs further before.  
  
How do you feel my speeches, evaluation, and table topics?  
The most common feedback I got so far is:  
  
"Your speech was logical"  
"Your speech was logical"  
"Your speech was logical"  
And
"You need to speak more emotionally"  
"You need more vocal variety"  
"You need more gestures"  
  
It sounds like I'm a logical monster or emotion less robot.  
Even the state of the art robots can understand/express emotions, I'm not.  
  
Yes, I WAS such a person, who is full of logics and data.  
But now, I'm started my journey to get emotion and become real human.  
  
Let me share how I am changing using a comparison before/after.

It is said that reading history is a reflection of one's personality.  
It seems I'm changing to understand human emotion.  
  
## Learning
  
- Before
   - Last two years I was learning at graduate school and finally got Master's degree in this spring.
      It was full of logics and facts.
- After 
   - I'm learning Modern Arts via online course
   - [Modern Art & Ideas](https://www.coursera.org/learn/modern-art-ideas)
  
I'm intentionally learning something other than logic during this time of stay at home.

## Playing
  
Recently, I bought a new [keyboard](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B01LYI06RT/)  
Oh! not this
but a [keyboard](https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B01LA2Y3D6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  
And practicing every day.  
My dream is mastering "Fly Me To the Moon" by the time when the pandemic ceases.
  
Those changes  
Fly me to the human world and let me play among humans.  
Let me see what emotions illustrate our life.  
In other words: I want be mature  
In other words: I love me
